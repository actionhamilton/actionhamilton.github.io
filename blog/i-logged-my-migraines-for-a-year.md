I've been having migraines for as long as I remember. Legend says that, even as a baby, I would cry and cry until I threw up, and it wasn't until I was able to speak my thoughts that anyone knew what was really going on. _Hint: my head hurt_.

Am I completely debilitated, unable to even perform life's basic tasks on a day-to-day basis? No; but I do get sudden, piercing pains in my head that cause nausea, auditory and olfactory sensitivity, and make me incredibly sad a few times a month.

A few times a month is still more than I should be getting them, no doubt about that. Prior to 2019, I would've told you I averaged 1-2 migraines a month. Now, in 2020, my answer would be 4-6 times a month. I know this because I kept track of each migraine I had last year.

## Why Did I Have So Many Migraines?
I'm still figuring that out. It's purely coincidental that I decided to finally keep a migraine log at the start of 2019. Years of being told to do so by doctors and friends alike (and not doing it) have resulted in pretty basic understanding of my patterns and triggers.

That's not to say it's all been a mystery before; I definitely was aware of myself. But now, I have a full year's worth of data from the time of day my migraine began, to what I ate before it happened, and even my general feelings that day. So, that general knowledge I stored in my brain is now a spreadsheet with lots of _graphs_.

## So, What Did I Know Going Into This?
Before I started this log, I had a fairly good understanding of my triggers, such as:
* Sudden changes in barometric pressure: honestly, I can't fully explain this one, but here's an article that [discusses it in depth](https://blog.themigrainereliefcenter.com/barometric-pressure-and-migraines-what-you-need-to-know).
* Stress: I think this one is actually self-explanatory.
* Bad sleep, or lack thereof: [healthy sleep and regular routines](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/sleep/), like going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, are positive habits.
* Over-processed foods: it turns out a full year of soda and frozen, ready-to-eat corndogs in takes a toll on more than your gut.

But that's about it. Stay healthy, exercise, get good sleep, don't stress out too much and things will be okay.

## What Did I Want To Know?
Working in marketing drew out this ~~potentially unhealthy~~ truly great relationship with data and spreadsheets that I didn't know I had in me. Thus, I wanted to know **everything**.

* What times of day am I most likely to get a migraine? (_it's a tie of 15 between 4:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. & 8:00 a.m. - noon_).
* Were there food triggers I didn't know I had? Maybe ones that are worse than I thought?
* Did one day of the week have a higher migraine occurrence? (_Mondays & Saturdays tied at 12_).
* Can I finetune my data to conquer my migraines once and for all? (_Spoiler Alert: not quite_).

In the end, I don't have as many graphs and charts as I expected to have. Part of the reason for that is I didn't want this project to consume me, but I'm proud of what I did get out of it and know how I can improve on it for this year.

## What Did I Find?
My main goal was coming out with a calendar heat map of my year. Preferably, I'd have it color coded to match the main trigger of the migraine. For the most part, I succeeded.

I created the calendar using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/troy.vassalotti#!/vizhome/Migraines2019/WorkingDash) with the following underlying data:
* Date
* Time
* Main Trigger
* Secondary Trigger

With all that, I was able to create this beautiful calendar of my suffering:

The most difficult part of this project was assigning a trigger for myself. While sometimes I can directly say "yeah, the amount of stress I was under is the reason," other times it's not that clear. I realized over the year that it's less "what was the cause?" and more "what _were_ the _causes_?"

See, getting poor sleep wasn't always enough to definitively cause a migraine; however, drinking the night before or a sudden storm coming through would likely put me in a bad situation the next day. Some of those situations are easier to control than others.

For example, I can't control the weather and tough times at work aren't always preventable. I am a pretty scheduled sleeper, but I know I miss out on a lot if I stick to it so rigidly.

I ended the year with 67 migraines. That's about 6 times a month on average, but in reality (as you can see by the calendar above) it was more like a month of feeling like crap, then the next month feeling fine, but feeling like crap again the month after. And it's not like I didn't try remedies out.
* Meditation came and went: I've been meditating for a couple years but fell out of routine last year.
* Prescriptions were changed: getting away from Excedrin when possible and reaching more for triptans.
* I found ways to disconnect work from normal life.

I'd say some helped - such as managing my work/life balance - but there was cause for concern about what the hell was going on with me. So, I took what I logged and made _even more_ changes.

## So Now What?
I started seeing a neurologist again and began taking a daily preventative. It's been two months of this regimen and progress has been good. As of writing this, I've had seven migraines in 2020. If you're keeping math at home, that's a month's worth of migraines in three months time.

I started meditating again on a regular schedule. It's not an _every day_ sort of thing, but it's been helping my mental state for sure. That, and my walkable commute to work.

And I'm really keeping tabs on my lifestyle, such as the things I eat, how I sleep, and coming to terms with knowing my triggers aren't completely avoidable, but I can at least try to not face too many at once.
