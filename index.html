    <h2>
      What's This All About?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I never thought I would be doing this. If you had asked me a few years ago if I ever thought I'd be learning how computers really work, then I would have told you no. I probably would have told you I'd be researching economic theory or touring the U.S. in a punk band (see top navigation).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, things changed in 2018. My job got more hands-on (email marketing, template building, mobile responsiveness) and as I'd research the answers to my problems - like why our company logo just wouldn't stay centered when it hit mobile inboxes - I learned I loved everything about it.

    <h3>
      So, what you'll find here...
    </h3>
    <p>
      I attended a Build A Website In A Weekend lesson from Betamore and this site was the outcome. I'm sure I'll delete some of these old pages in the future, but for now it's a good historic record of how far I've come (or will go).
