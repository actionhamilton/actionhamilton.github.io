I decided to give troy. - a band I have - a website. While I don't do anything serious with the band, it was fun to make something on the internet. It's a very simple website built with Eleventy, but I used Pug templates this time! As with most small projects I put myself through, it was an opportunity to learn something new or experiment with a feature of the web that I haven't explored much of before.
