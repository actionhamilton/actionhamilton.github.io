I found this video years ago but never saved it. Since I recently found out HBO Max has the first eight seasons of _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_, this video resurfaced in my mind. After far too many queries on search engines like "colin.mp4," "colin.avi", "colin mochrie meme dance gif", the letters "swf" came back to me. I bookmarked the video, downloaded it to local storage, and am now writing a post about it in hopes of never losing it ever again.
