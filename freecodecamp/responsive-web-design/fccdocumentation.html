        <header>Fundamentals of Music Theory</header>
          <p>Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.</p>
          <p><i>The Oxford Companion to Music</i> describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Rudiments," currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on.</li>
            <li>The study of writings about music from ancient times onwards.</li>
            <li>An area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music â€” a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Pitch">
        <header>Pitch</header>
        <p>Pitch is the lowness or highness of a tone, for example the difference between middle C and a higher C.</p>
        <p>The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Scales_and_Modes">
        <header>Scales and Modes</header>
        <p>Notes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a chromatic scale, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or semitone. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.</p>
        <p>The most commonly encountered scales are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Seven-toned Major</li>
          <li>Harmonic Minor</li>
          <li>Melodic Minor</li>
          <li>Natural Minor</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Consonance_and_Dissonance">
        <header>Consonance and Dissonance</header>
        <p>Consonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages. Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval.</p>
        <code>
        Dissonant intervals seem to clash.
        Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together.
        </code>
        <p>Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Rhythm">
        <header>Rhythm</header>
        <p>Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter measures music in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars. The time signature or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.</p>
        <p>Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. Syncopated rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat. Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called polyrhythm.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Melody">
        <header>Melody</header>
        <p>A melody is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.</p>
        <code>
          The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo.
        </code>
        <p>The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as scales or modes.</p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>
          Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure,
          motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and
          period or sentence.
        </code>
        <p>The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Chord">
        <header>Chord</header>
        <p>A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously. These need not actually be played together: arpeggios and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern Western, West African, and Oceanian music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>The most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes:</p>
        <code>
         further notes may be added to give seventh chords,
          extended chords, or added tone chords
        </code>
        <p>The most common chords are the major and minor triads and then the augmented and diminished triads.</p>
        <code>
        The descriptions major, minor, augmented,
          and diminished are sometimes referred to collectively
        as chordal quality.
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Harmony">
        <header>Harmony</header>
        <p>In music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the "horizontal" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Timbre">
        <header>Timbre</header>
        <p>Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature.</p>
        <code>
          It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional
          waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled
          pitch or loudness," but can be accurately described and
          analyzed by Fourier analysis and other methods because
          it results from the combination of all sound frequencies,
          attack and release envelopes, and other qualities
          that a tone comprises.
        </code>
        <p>Timbre is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of overtones produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the envelope of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time).</p>
        <code>
          Timbre varies widely between different instruments,
          voices, and to lesser degree,
          between instruments of the same type due to
          variations in their construction, and significantly,
          the performer's technique.
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Dynamics">
        <header>Dynamics</header>
        <p>In music, "dynamics" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in decibels or phons. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.</p>
        <p>The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forte (f) for loud</li>
          <li>Piano (p) for soft</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These two basic notations are modified by indications including mezzo piano (mp) for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and mezzo forte (mf) for moderately loud, sforzando or sforzato (sfz) for a surging or "pushed" attack, or fortepiano (fp) for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible pianissississimo (pppp) to a loud-as-possible fortissississimo (ffff).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Articulation">
        <header>Articulation</header>
        <p>Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, staccato is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, legato performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.</p>
        <code>
          Staccato is often referred to as "separated" or "detached"
          rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to
          reduce the notated duration.
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Texture">
        <header>Texture</header>
        <p>In music, texture is how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Form_or_Structure">
        <header>Form or Structure</header>
        <p>The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.</p>
        <code>
        In the tenth edition of <i>The Oxford Companion to Music</i>,
        Percy Scholes defines musical form as "a series of strategies
        designed to find a successful mean between the opposite
        extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."
